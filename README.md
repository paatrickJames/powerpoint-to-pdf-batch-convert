# powerpoint-to-pdf-batch-convert

Credit to @mp4096 ( https://gist.github.com/mp4096 ) for the script I only slightly modified the script and added an archive folder.

This is a powershell script that will batch convert all .ppt and .pptx files to .pdf format in the current folder and all sub folders. The script will also archive all powerpoint files to a folder in the $curr_path.
